This directory contains a prepackaged version of HtmlPrag version 0.13
for Scsh, the Scheme Shell (http://www.scsh.net).

For more information on HtmlPrag visit

   http://www.neilvandyke.org/htmlprag/

This library can also be used with Scheme 48.

* Installation and Usage

** Scsh

To install this package I recommend the Scsh Installation Library,
available from

   http://lamp.epfl.ch/~schinz/scsh_packages/

I used version 1.1.2.

Running the installation script (scsh-install-pkg) in this directory
will install the library.

To use the library just start Scsh with the options

   -lel htmlprag/load.scm -o htmlprag

** Scheme 48

Copy the files "htmlprag.scm" and "packages.scm" to some directory.
At the Scheme 48 prompt type

   ,config ,load /path/to/packages.scm

followed by

   ,open htmlprag

Alternatively you might want to dump a new image with HtmlPrag
preloaded.  See the Scheme 48 documentation for details.
