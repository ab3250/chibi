This directory contains files for SLLGEN, an LL(1) lexer & parser generator
I wrote for my COM3351 programming languages class.

The parser generator does a correct LL(1) parser generation, including
checking for the LL(1) property.

The package currently runs in Chez Scheme.  A compatibility package for MIT
Scheme is included.  It should be easy to port to MacGambit and scm; anyone
who is interested should let me know.

The files are:

sllgen.scm		Source code for the system

chezmacros.scm		Macro package for Chez Scheme

mitmacros.scm		Macro package for MIT scheme

intro.ps		User's guide (such as it is).  This is actually the
			notes from lectue 3 of my PL course.

example.scm		An example that we use extensively in the course.
