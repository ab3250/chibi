car2-dev status on x86_64

TBD. will either fail or take a long time to finish:
- compiler.scm - Never finishes compiling (during previous testing)
- earley.scm - should run, just may take awhile
- graphs.scm - seems like not working on 64 bit, GC memory usage is constant, with too many allocations
  I think what is happening is that there are a lot of requests for objects on the REST heap, most of
  size 96 but some of 128 (or maybe larger?). this causes heap fragmentation and over time makes it
  take a long time to find larger free chunks (> 96) on this heap.
  need to address the fragmentation issue somehow. can either kick the can down the road and add a 96 byte
  heap, or figure out a more general solution (have N fixed sized heaps, allocate arrays in fixed sized chunks, ??)

- mbrotZ.scm - No complex library, this should still fail
- pi.scm - Needs bignum support
- slatex.scm - Cyclone hangs during the CPS optimization phase
