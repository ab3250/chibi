<h1>SRFI 14 Charset Definitions</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document provides modern definitions of the standard <a href=
"http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/srfi-14.html">SRFI 14</a>
character sets in terms of Unicode properties. The definitions in
the published SRFI were taken from Java 1.0, which means they
reflect data and interpretations as of Unicode 2.0. The Unicode
version at the time of writing (2019-11-13) is 12.1, so some
corrections and expansions are in order.</p>
<p>Unicode publishes many properties of characters in the Unicode
database online. This document recommends that Scheme implementers
who wish to provide Unicode versions of SRFI 14 use these to write
a program generating a current list of Unicode characters that fit
into each of the standard sets. The program can then provide the
result in some way that the implementation can use, either as
S-expressions, as binary files, or in some other way. This program
should be re-run at least every six months as new versions of
Unicode are published. However, it is very rare to unheard-of for
any character to be removed from any character set. Of course, as
new characters are added to Unicode (no characters have been
removed since Unicode 2.0), the standard character sets grow over
time.</p>
<p>The Unicode files we need are found on the <a href=
"http://unicode.org/">unicode.org</a> web site. The <a href=
"https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>
file contains the General Category, a 2-letter code that groups all
Unicode characters into one of thirty classes. For example,
<code>Lu</code> means "upper case letter" and <code>Sm</code> means
"mathematical symbol". The <a href=
"https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/PropList.txt">PropList.txt</a>
and <a href=
"https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/DerivedCoreProperties.txt">DerivedCoreProperties.txt</a>
files provide various properties of either single Unicode
characters or ranges of them. For example, the property
<code>Deprecated</code> applies to the characters whose existence
is the result of a mistake or whose use is strongly discouraged.
Characters can and generally do, have more than one property.</p>
<h2>Parsing UnicodeData.txt</h2>
<p>UnicodeData.txt is a very straightforward file with multiple
fields separated by <code>;</code> characters. Field 1 is the
Unicode codepoint in hex: four, five, or six characters. Field 2 is
normally the official name of the character. Field 3 is the General
Category.</p>
<p>However, there is one special convention to make the file
shorter. If the content of field 2 begins with <code>&lt;</code>
and ends with <code>First&gt;</code>, then it represents the first
codepoint in a range of characters that all have the same
properties and whose names are generated algorithmically. All such
lines are immediately followed by another special line beginning
with <code>&lt;</code> and ending with <code>Last&gt;</code>, which
specifies the last codepoint of the range.</p>
<p>For example, the consecutive lines</p>
<div class="codehilite">
<pre>4E00;&lt;CJK Ideograph, First&gt;;Lo;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;
9FEF;&lt;CJK Ideograph, Last&gt;;Lo;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;
    </pre></div>
<p>mean that all characters from U+4E00 to U+9FEF inclusive belong
to category Lo.</p>
<h2>Parsing PropList.txt and DerivedCoreProperties.txt</h2>
<p>The format of PropList.txt and DerivedCoreProperties.txt is more
complicated but more flexible. Comments beginning with
<code>#</code> may appear on any line and go to the end of the
line; a line beginning with <code>#</code> is a comment. All such
comments, as well as blank lines, should be completely ignored.
Spaces within lines should also be discarded.</p>
<p>After that, the files contain two fields separated by
<code>;</code>. Field 1 is either a single hex codepoint or else
two hex codepoints separated by <code>..</code> designating the
first and last codepoints in the range. Field 2 is Unicode's
standard name for the property.</p>
<h2>Definitions of the sets</h2>
<p>Each set is defined as the union of specified general
categories, properties, other character sets, single codepoints,
and ranges of codepoints (using the <code>..</code> notation of
PropList.txt).</p>
<p>The definitions are based on comments in
DerivedCoreProperties.txt, chapter 2 of the Unicode Standard, and
other places, with some help from the C/C++/Posix definitions.
Unicode uses the term <i>graphic characters</i> to include
whitespace, but here we follow Posix and call them <i>printable
characters</i>, restricting the former term to exclude
whitespace.</p>
<p>The notation <code>L*</code> is not a specific category, but
represents the union of all categories beginning with
<code>L</code>, namely <code>Ll Lu Lo Lt Lm</code>, and similarly
for all other category codes.</p>
