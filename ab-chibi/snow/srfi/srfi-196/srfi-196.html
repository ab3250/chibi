<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Ranges are immutable collections that can be enumerated but are
represented algorithmically rather than by a per-element data
structure.  This SRFI defines a large subset of the sequence operations
defined on lists, vectors, and other collections.  If necessary,
a range can be converted to a list or vector of its elements or a generator
that will lazily produce each element in the range.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

None at present.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>One of the most common things to do in programming is to execute
a block of code a fixed number of times, with access to the index
used for the iteration.  Indeed, it is so common that there is generally
a standard syntax for providing it, generally involving the keyword
<code>for</code> (or if not, as in Fortran and Lisp, the word
<code>do</code>).  It is also usual to be able to provide a lower bound,
generally defaulting to 0 or 1, as well as step size, allowing
iterations through a sequence of odd numbers, or multiples of 10,
or whatever.</p>

<p>Languages with higher order functions, however, provide a second
approach to such loops: construct a sequence of numbers and apply
a function to each element of the sequence.  SRFI 1's <code>iota</code>
and the standard <code>for-each</code> procedures make this easy:
<code>(for-each (lambda (i) ...) (iota 0 10))</code>
will execute the expressions represented as <code>...</code>
with <code>i</code> bound to the numbers 0 through 9, as
the generated list includes the lower bound and excludes the upper bound.</p>

<p>This approach is less feasible as the number of numbers grows.
To iterate a million times involves constructing a list of a million
numbers to be iterated over and immediately discarded as garbage.
This is not something you want to do in the inner loop of your code.
The range objects of this SRFI represent such sequences using only
a small fixed amount of storage.  Using
<code>(range-for-each (lambda (i) ...) (numeric-range 0 1000000))</code>
iterates a million times but with less space overhead than
<code>iota</code>'s list of ten elements.</p>

<p>In addition, there are other sequences besides integers from
which a range may be drawn.  In particular, inexact numbers can
also specify ranges: <code>(numeric-range 0.0 1.0 0.1)</code>
specifies the sequence 0.0, 0.1, ... 0.9.  For another
example, the basic Latin capital letters A-Z can be specified using
a range constructed by <code>(range char-comparator #\A 26
(lambda (c n) (integer->char (+ (char->integer c) n))))</code>.
And to specify the geometric sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, &hellip;, 1/512,
<code>(range real-comparator 1/2 10 expt)</code> will do the job.
These comparators can be found in SRFI 162.

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Note: The size of a range object is independent of the
number of elements it contains.</p>

<h3 id="constructors">Constructors</h3>
<p><code>(range</code>&nbsp;<em>comparator lower-bound length indexer</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range whose lower bound is <i>lower-bound</i>
and whose length (number of elements) is <i>length</i>.
The <i>indexer</i> procedure returns the <i>n</i>th element
(where 0 &#x2264; <i>n</i> &lt; <i>length</i>)
of the range given <i>lower-bound</i> and <i>n</i>.
The comparator object <i>comparator</i> is used to determine
if a value is within the range or not.
This procedure must run in O(1) time.</p>

<p>There is a constraint on indexers:
It is an error if an indexer <code>indexer</code>
does not satisfy the following identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>(indexer lower-bound k)</code> is equal to
<code>(indexer (indexer lower-bound k) 0)</code>
</blockquote>
<p>for all values of <code>k</code> between 0 (inclusive)
and the highest value which will ever be passed as the
second argument to <code>indexer</code> (exclusive).
This constraint cannot be checked by the implementation, but if
violated will cause various other procedures to misbehave.
</p>

<p><code>(numeric-range</code>&nbsp;<em>start end</em> [<em>step</em>]<code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a numeric range, a special case of a range specified by an
inclusive lower bound <em>start</em>, an exclusive upper bound <em>end</em>, and a
<em>step</em> value (default 1), all of which can be exact or inexact real
numbers. Its comparator is the natural comparator on real numbers,
and its indexer is
<code>(lambda (bound n) (+ bound (* n step)))</code>.
It is an error if <i>end</i> - <i>start</i> is not a
multiple of <i>step</i>.
This procedure must run in O(1) time.</p>

<p>Note that an effect of this definition is that the elements of
a range over inexact numbers are enumerated by multiplying the index
by the step value rather than by adding the step value to itself
repeatedly.  This reduces the likelihood of roundoff errors.</p>


<h3 id="predicates">Predicates</h3>

<p><code>(range?</code>&nbsp;<em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is a range and <code>#f</code>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The sample implementation is in the repository of this SRFI.
An R7RS library file and a separate file containing the actual
implementation are provided, along with a test file that
works with SRFI 78, but is self-contained if SRFI 78 does not exist.
The implementation needs SRFI 128, and can take
advantage of SRFI 145 (<code>assume</code>) if it is present.</p>
