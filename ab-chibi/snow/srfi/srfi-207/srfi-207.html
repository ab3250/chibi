<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>To ease the human reading and writing of Scheme code involving strings encoded as bytevectors in ASCII-related encodings, a notation for bytevectors is proposed which allows printable ASCII characters to be used literally without being converted to their corresponding integer forms.

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>Should there be a special version of <code>write</code> which forces the use of this notation?

<p>I notice R6RS actually uses <code>#vu8</code> for its built-in bytevectors where everyone else uses <code>#u8</code>. Should that be supported with a string notation too?

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>When bytevectors contain string data in an ASCII-related character encoding (e.g. UTF-8 or ISO 8859), it is much more tractable for human programmers to deal with them in the form <code>#u8"recursion"</code> than in the form <code>#u8(114 101 99 117 114 115 105 111 110)</code>; this is true for strings in many languages which use the Latin script, even when small numbers of non-ASCII characters are used (<code>#u8"r\xE9;cursivit\xE9;"</code>).

<p>In this specification it is assumed that bytevectors are as defined in R7RS-small 6.9. Implementations may also consider them equivalent to R6RS bytevectors (R6RS 4.3.4) or SRFI 4 <code>u8vector</code>s, depending which kind of homogeneous vectors of unsigned 8-bit integers an implementation supports.

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>The basic form of a string-notated bytevector is:

<blockquote><code>#u8"</code> <var>content</var> <code>"</code></blockquote>

<p>To avoid character encoding issues within string-notated bytevectors, only printable ASCII characters (that is, Unicode codepoints in the range from U+0020 to U+007E inclusive) are allowed to be used within the <var>content</var> of a string-notated bytevector. All other characters must be expressed through mnemonic or inline hex escapes, and <code>"</code> and <code>\</code> must also be escaped as in normal Scheme strings.

<p>Within the <var>content</var> of a string-notated bytevector:

<ul>
  <li>the sequence <code>\"</code> represents the integer 34;
  <li>the sequence <code>\\</code> represents the integer 92;
  <li>the following mnemonic sequences represent the corresponding integers:
    <table>
      <tr><th>Seq.            <th>Integer
      <tr><td><code>\a</code> <td>7
      <tr><td><code>\b</code> <td>8
      <tr><td><code>\t</code> <td>9
      <tr><td><code>\n</code> <td>10
      <tr><td><code>\r</code> <td>13
    </table>
  <li>the sequence <code>\x</code> followed by one or two hexadecimal digits followed by <code>;</code> represents the integer specified;
  <li>any other printable ASCII character represents the character number of that character in the ASCII/Unicode code chart; and
  <li>it is an error to use any other character or sequence beginning with <code>\</code> within a string-notated bytevector.
</ul>

<p>When the Scheme reader encounters a string-notated bytevector, it produces a datum as if that bytevector had been written out in full. That is, <code>#u8"A"</code> is exactly equivalent to <code>#u8(65)</code>.

<p>A Scheme implementation which supports string-notated bytevectors may not by default use this notation when any of the <code>write</code> family of procedures is called upon a bytevector or upon another datum containing a bytevector. A future SRFI is expected to add a configurable version of the <code>write</code> procedure which may enable the use of this notation in this context.

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<h3>Formal syntax</h3>

<p>The formal syntax of Scheme (defined in R7RS-small 7.1) is amended as follows.

<ul>
<li><p>In the definition of ⟨token⟩, after ‘| ⟨string⟩’, insert ‘| ⟨string-notated bytevector⟩’.
<li><p>After the definition of ⟨byte⟩ is inserted:
   <blockquote>
    <p>⟨string-notated bytevector⟩ &rarr; <code>#u8"</code> ⟨string-notated bytevector element⟩* <code>"</code><br>
    ⟨string-notated bytevector element⟩ &rarr; ⟨any printable ASCII character other than <code>"</code> or <code>\</code>⟩<br>
    <span style="margin-left:1em">| ⟨mnemonic escape⟩ | <code>\"</code> | <code>\\</code></span><br>
    <span style="margin-left:1em">| <code>\</code>⟨intraline whitespace⟩*⟨line ending⟩⟨intraline whitespace⟩*</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left:1em">| ⟨inline hex escape⟩</span>
   </blockquote>
</ul>

<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>This notation is inspired by the notation used in Python since version 2.6 for <code>bytes</code> objects, which are fundamentally similar in purpose to Scheme bytevectors, especially in R7RS.

<p>Lassi Kortela corrected an embarrassing technical error. Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen explained why the <code>write</code> procedure ought not to be allowed to use this notation by default.
