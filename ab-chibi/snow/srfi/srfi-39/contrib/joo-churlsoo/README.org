This is an alternative implementation of SRFI 39 provided by Joo
ChurlSoo.

When asked to compare this implementation to the one included in the
SRFI document, Joo responded:

  It's literally just another implementation.

  Forcibly comparing, it is like the relationship between pair and
  list.

  One is comprehensive and extensible, while the other is simple but
  easy to understand.
